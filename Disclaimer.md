All analisys are performed "as is". This is not a real life wine production example. The hypothesis are very, very loose and were made in favor of simplicity. We are aware that any hyperparameter tuning, choice of random seed, number of epochs, batch size and architectural choices may drastically change the results. We may or may not post any work in this sense, as well as complete cross validated analisys, in the near future. You should take the here present notebook with a grain of salt. These are only evidences of the observed facts, not scientific truths. If you are to use this for serious purposes, included but not limmited to assignments, publications and commercial demonstration and I don't hold accountable.
