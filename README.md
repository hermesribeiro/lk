## Abstract
In this notebook, we highlight the main implications of using DL to fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) problems. We explore the FDD problem in the two dimensional space, to gain insight and analize the advantages of having multiple hidden layers on an ANN for process identification discipline. We make a case for wine production, to detect faults affecting the product's sweetness and tanins concentration during fermentation. We show that, providing cues in the neural architecture, as well as using a fully connected deep neural architecture, makes the model realize the root causes for quality variables misspecification.
