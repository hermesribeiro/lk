Deep Learning for chemical process engineering

## This is a work in progress
In this notebook, we will hoghlight the main implications of using DL to fault detection and diagnosis problems. We explore the FDI problem
in the two dimensional space to gain indight and analize the advantages of having multiple hidden layers on an ANN
for process identification discipline.
